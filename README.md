# Deep Learning & Neural Networks Project 🚀

## 1. Customer Churn Prediction with ANN

This project builds a machine learning model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict customer churn for a bank. The model is trained on real customer data, and a Streamlit web application provides an interactive interface for making predictions.

### 🔑 Key Files

- `Churn_Modelling.csv`: Dataset used to train the ANN model.
- `model.h5`: Pre-trained ANN model.
- `label_encoder_gender.pkl`, `onehot_encoder_geo.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`: Preprocessing tools for encoding and scaling data.
- `app.py`: Streamlit app for real-time customer churn predictions.
